# **_Namaste_ üôè** I'm Sreevarsh Vasista Pamidimukkala.
### Welcome to the tech side of a **Fullstack Developer üî•**

- I'm currently employed by [Koach.Ai](www.koach.ai), where we're building a robust backend and an all ages friendly frontend mobile app to educate and bring focus to one of the most needed skills to get employed: **Soft Skills**
### What am I doing? 
- After building multiple APIs and designing efficient flows in the backend, I'm currently working on making our mobile app look better {and perform better _specially on low end devices_}
- But low end devices shouldn't necessarily mean lower user experience, and that got me into learning CSS animations and GSAP {_livesaver surely_}

### Tech Stack that I use;
